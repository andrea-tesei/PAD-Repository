# PAD-Repository
My personal repository for the "Distributed Enabling Platform" exam.

This repository contains all exercise and projects made during the Distributed Enabling Platform exam. 
The final project is composed by "ConsistentHashing", "Versioning", "gossip", "PADfs" and "PADfs-cli" projects.
The README of each of these projects is under costruction.
